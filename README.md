## 🔍 Why Documentor?

Reviewing and understanding contracts can be overwhelming. Manual analysis demands legal expertise and time — often causing delays in important decisions.

Documentor makes this process **faster, safer, and smarter** by:
- 🚩 Identifying vague clauses, hidden risks, and inconsistencies
- 🤝 Highlighting potential risks and suggesting negotiation points
- ⏱️ Reducing manual review efforts and legal dependencies
- 🧠 Helping non-experts confidently manage and understand documents
- 💰 Minimizing reliance on expensive external legal reviews
